# Visualizing the interaction between structural disruption and functional connectivity

For more background, see my [other repo](https://github.com/adbartni/masters).

The code in this repository is used to create a Shiny webapp in R to easily visualize how structural disruption impact deviations in functional connectivity.

The main benefit of doing this is that a Shiny webapp makes it very easy to interact with our data and visualize what would be hundreds of graphs. This is acheived by making it possible to select a brain region from a list and seeing graphs of all connections to that region that are statistically relevant. 

From this we can see how well our data fits our assumption of a linear model, or how a power transformation affects our model.

This is intended to briefly inform future decision of statistical analyses.
