## Things to accomplish

 - ~~Successfully plot all connections for a region interactively~~
 - ~~Add DTI data~~
 - ~~Use absolute lesional discon~~ Using proportional
 - ~~Look into shinydashboard (https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/)
	- Create a dashboard for ~~absolute~~ proportional lesional discon
	- Create a dashboard for dti
	- Make it easy to go between the two (dashboard makes it easier)~~
 - ~~Possibly install muti to find mutual information~~, mi.plugin works for now though
 - ~~Find and add missing subjects from full correlation change in functional connectivity~~
 - Examine direction of functional connectivity change within and without of networks
 - Rank connections by R2, rho, and p for correlations
